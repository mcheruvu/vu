        <b>Dr. Venkata Chaganti’s Ph.D. research: </b> <br/>
        Dr. Venkata R Chaganti is a doctorate in condensed matter physics from Georgia State University. 
          Quantum dots strongly exhibit size-dependent optical and electrical properties. The ability
          to join the dots into complex assemblies creates many opportunities for scientific discovery. This
          motivated his research work on QDIPs, DWELLs, and graphene like QDs. The intention of his
          research was to study the size dependent achievements of QDIPs, DWELLs, and graphene like QDs with
          those of competitive technologies, with the emphasis on the material properties, device structure, and
          their impact on the device performance.
        </p>
        <p>
        Dr. Venkata Chaganti taught undergraduate physics courses (both lab and classroom) in USA 
        college/universities for about 11 years. He worked as an IT consultant and Biomedical Engineer. 
        His work as Biomedical Engineer is to Sales and Service of Biomedical Equipment like ECG, EEG, 
        Intra-Aortic Balloon Pumps, Stress Test equipment, Monitors etc. As an IT consultant he worked in 
        C, C++, Java, FORTRAN, Android App development.

    <h4>Vēdic Background</h4>
    <p class="pt-4 pb-4">
      
      Apart from the University’s research in Quantum dots, he did independent research in Vēdas and Shāstrās 
      for the past 30+ years. He worked on Science in Vēdas and Shāstrās that became unavailable to the present society. 
      One such aspect is reducing air pollution with the help of Vēdic Yajnas. For the past 12 years he worked on 
      Vēdic Yajnas by registering a nonprofit organization called Vedas World Inc and has a website 
      <a class="a_underline" href="www.vedas.us" target="nw">www.vedas.us</a> that is maintained from 2010, 
      <a class="a_underline"  href="www.vedas.world" target="nw">www.vedas.world</a> that is maintained from 2019, 
      <a  class="a_underline" href="www.vedasworld.org" target="nw">www.vedasworld.org</a> maintained from 2021. 
    </p>

    <h4>YouTube Channel</h4>
    <p class="pt-4">
      Dr. Venkata Chaganti maintains a YouTube channel on which he made more than 900 videos to 
      transfer knowledge pertaining to Vēdas, Yajnas, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Upanishads, Darashanas, 
      Puranas, and other related literature. He has more than 32,000 subscribers on YouTube.

          Dr. Venkata Chaganti is the President for <a class="a_underline" href="www.vedas.wiki" target="nw">Vēdas Wiki</a>, a non-profit organization. 
          He prepared more than 10 million research works from a single Rigveda Mantra that projects and 
          extracts data from other Rigvēda Mantras. This is an extensive work that can be used to find the 
          properties of Agni, Surya, Vidyut, Ishwar, Vayu, Indra, Yajna, etc., that can be used in 
          modern sciences for beneficial and commercial purposes.

        Dēvathas inside our body (Bright Ākāsham, Vāyu, Agni, Jalam, Prithvi, Vāk, Manas, Chakshu, and Shrōthram etc., providing energy. 
      Jnan Indriyās, Karma Indriyās, Pancha Bhūthās), Dēvatha that is prominent in our body, 
      five parts of Prānna – What protects the body, Prānna is superior to Indriyās, 
      Prānna as Agni-Sūrya-Vidyut, Vāyu that purifies, Prithvi that accommodates, and 
      Raē that is small and big and indestructible, Vēdas-Yagna-Kshātram and knowledge are spokes of the wheel Prānna, 
      praise Prānna and its different forms, Is Prānna present in Dēvathās?, What do Pithara, and 
      Rishis seek from Prānna?, Prānna is Indra-Rudra-Ākāsham, Prānna is the protector of stars and 
      Sun, What is Prānna?, Prānna Rains to give abundant food, Prānna is always pure, 
      Prānna responsible for joy, Prānna produces Vāyu, Prānna in the form Apāna in the Vāk, 
      Prānna as Vyāna in the Shravanna, Prānna as Prānna in the Nēthram, Prānna as Samāna in Manas, 
      Prānna in control of the three worlds, Prānna protects us as a mother protects her children, 
      Prānna gives us enlightenment and knowledge, From what does this Prānna evolve?, 
      How does Prānna enter the body?, How does Prānna divide itself into different forms?, 
      How does Prānna stabilize inside the body?, How does Prānna exit from the body?, 
      How does Prānna bear the external knowledge, joy and sufferings?, Paramāthma &rarr; Āthma &rarr; Prānna Vāyu 
      just as Sun &rarr; Object &rarr; shade, Āthma due to Karma &rarr; Prānna Vāyu enters body, King &rarr; Ministers similarly 
      Prānna Vāyu &rarr; other Prānna Vāyus, Apāna Vāyu &rarr; excretion and reproduction organs. Prānna Vāyu (Face) &rarr; Eyes, 
      Nose, Ears and Mouth. Samāna Vāyu is present in the naval &rarr; digestion and distribution of food, 
      Jivāthma or Āthma present in the brain, in the brain there are 101 main nerves, from each one of these main nerves, 
      100 sub-nerves are emerged-and from each one of these sub-nerves emerge 72,000-minute nerves - 
      In all these sub-nerves Vyāna Vāyu is propagating, duty of Vyāna Vāyu, Udāna Vāyu resides in one of the 
      main nerves of the brain, Udāna Vāyu responsible in carrying the soul and placing it different bodies after death,

      animal bodies and a soul of mixed nature to human body, Prānna &rarr; living body, Sūrya &rarr; Virāt, Prānna helps 
      in the human body and stabilizes it, Vāyu present on earth is Apāna for Virāt, Ākāsham is Samāna, Heat in 
      the body is Udāna, when Udāna subsides in the body - Āthma with Manas enters into another body, Karmas are 
      stored in the memory of the Āthma, Āthma takes the memory and with the help of Udāna enters a new body which 
      is suitable for the print stored in memory [That means we design our own future body due to our past karmas], 
      Knowing Prānna &rarr; fame and Yogi’s generation will also be famous, Scholars who know about the entry of Prānna as 
      birth-division of Prānna-place of Prānna-spreading of Prānna-activity of Prānna will get Mukthi. </p>
      
      <p>Indriyās that are in sleeping state, Indriyās that are in awaken state, Dēvatha that dreams, who gets the pleasure?, 
      In which or in whom all living beings and matter are stabilized?, Just as the Sun sets all the rays 
      are accumulated in the space and at dawn all the rays from the Sun again spread on the Earth, 
      similarly all the Indriyās get accumulated inside the Manas. Due to this reason at that time 
      human beings cannot hear, or see, or smell, or touch, or taste, or walk, or talk, or catch, or 
      enjoy any pleasure and excrete- the person is said to be sleeping, Person is sleeping &rarr; Panchāgnis 
      will be in awakening state. Apāna &rarr; Gārhapatyāgni, Vyāna &rarr; Dakshināgni and Prānna &rarr; Āhavaniyāgni. 
      [Gārhapatyāgni is the support of Dakshināgni and Āhavaniyāgni. From Gārhapatyāgni, 
      fire is taken to use for cooking and also fire is taken to perform havan which is called Āhavaniyāgni], 
      Samāna &rarr; inhaling and exhaling, Jivāthma&rarr;Yajamān, Udāna is the result expected from the control of 
      Samāna with the help of Prānnāyāma, Udāna is responsible in carrying Jivāthma to Brahmam, Jivāthma sees 
      Mahathvam (wonders) in dreams, sometimes Jivāthma sees the past life experiences also in the dreams, 
      Jivāthma covered by Thējas &rarr; it does not dream but experiences joy- state is called Sushupthi and during 
      this state Jivāthma is with Paramāthma, Just as birds stay in nests during night &rarr; all Jivāthma reside 
      very stable in Paramāthma, Pancha Bhūthās, Jnānēndriyās and the matter perceived by them, Karmēndriyās and 
      the works performed by them, Manas and the thought process, Buddhi, Chittam, Ahankāra and their matter, 
      Thējas and its brilliance, Prānna and that it supports are all in Paramāthma. </p>

      <p>
      The “one” that resides inside the body and sees with eyes, hears with ears, touches with skin, smells with nose, 
      tastes with tongue, thinks with mind, knows with Buddhi, does work with hands and legs, is knowledgeable, 
      and is minute is called Jivāthma, Jivāthma is indestructible and is inside Paramāthma, Paramāthma&rarr;shapeless, 
      bodiless, bloodless, pure, indestructible – Yogi knows this Truth and will acquire Mukthi and become all 
      knowledgeable, Jivāthma with Indriyās, Pancha Prānnās, and Pancha Bhūthās reside inside the indestructible 
      Paramāthma, Who gets the knowledge of the Universe?, What happens if Meditating ‘AUM’ throughout his/her life?, 
      Para Brahmam, Apara Brahmam, wonders achieved with meditation of a one Māthra of ‘AUM’-win the Earth and make 
      him/her enjoy the wonders with Brahmacharya, Meditation on two Māthrās of ‘AUM’-blessed with stable mind and 
      Yajus Mantrās will take to Chandra Lōka and will enjoy the wealth and come back, Meditation is on all the 
      three Māthrās of ‘AUM’, attain Brahmam and enjoy the bliss-Just like a snake leaves its outer skin, similarly 
      this person who meditates on the three Māthrās of ‘AUM’ will get rid of all sins and acquire Mukthi, 
      Interrelation of three Māthrās of ‘AUM’-Appropriate use of three Māthrās in the inner, medium, and 
      outer Kriyā of meditation, appropriate use of the three Māthrās of ‘AUM’, gain of materialistic knowledge 
      from Rig Vēda, Agnihōtra and other Karmas, Who knows the sixteen arts and what are these arts?</p>

      <p>
      Who is the “One” within us?, What makes Jivāthma to stay inside the body and what makes to come out?, 
      The sixteen arts are Prānna, Shraddha, Ākāsham, Vāyu, Agni, Jalam, Prithvi, Indriyās, Manas, Annam, Viryam, 
      Thappas, Mantrās, Karmas, people, and names” [These are the sixteen arts and are well known by God], 
      Jivāthma-16 arts-Paramāthma, Wheel rim (Jivāthma), spokes of the wheel (16 arts), center of the wheel (Paramāthma), 
      There is nothing minute than Paramāthma, Who is the Path finder to Paramāthma?, Bhuvana Gōptha (who protects the world), 
      Guru parampara - Adharva learnt from Brahma, then Angira learnt it from Adharva, then Sathyavahana learnt it 
      from Angira and then Angirasa learnt it from Sathyavahana, The ‘One’ thing that if known, the entire universe is known, 
      Para and Apara vidya, Classification of Para and Apara vidya, Para vidya can be acquired only by meditation, 
      Indestructible matter, Brahma &rarr; Prakrithi &rarr; Mahathathvam &rarr; Anthahkarannam &rarr; Thanmātrās
