                    <h4 class="my-3">Arbitration</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or
                        concerning these Terms and Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or
                        otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved
                        only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single
                        neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration
                        service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
                        award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the
                        event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these
                        Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
                        attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms and
                        Conditions or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions, whether directly or
                        indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree
                        that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. The
                        entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be
                        determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration provision shall survive the termination of these Terms
                        and Conditions.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="my-3">Class Action Waiver</h4>
                    <p>

                        arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. THE PARTIES AGREE
                        THAT A PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN EACH'S
                        INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY
                        PUTATIVE CLASS, COLLECTIVE AND/ OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, SUCH
                        AS IN THE FORM OF A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION AGAINST THE
                        OTHER. Further, unless both you and University of Applied Vēdic Sciences agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                        consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
                        representative or class proceeding.

                    <p>
                        University of Applied Vēdic Sciences reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to the Site and
                        the related services or any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent
                        permitted by law, this agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas and you hereby
                        consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Texas in all disputes arising out of or
                        relating to the use of the Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give
                        effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section.
                        You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between
                        you and University of Applied Vēdic Sciences as a result of this agreement or use of the Site. University of Applied Vēdic Sciences's
                        performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained
                        in this agreement is in derogation of University of Applied Vēdic Sciences's right to comply with governmental, court and
                        law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided
                        to or gathered by University of Applied Vēdic Sciences with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is
                        determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to,
                        the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable
                        provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches
                        the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect.
                        Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user
                        and University of Applied Vēdic Sciences with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                        communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and University of Applied Vēdic Sciences
                        Yantra with respect to the Site. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
                        electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating
                        to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
                        documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish
                        to the parties that this agreement and all related documents be written in English.
