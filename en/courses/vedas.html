        <h3 class="pt-4 pb-4">Introduction to Vēdas</h3>
        <p>
            Vēdas contain all factual education (Vidya) of past, present and future. 
            Vēdas contain basically two types of education1, (1) Apara Vidya and (2) Para Vidya.  
            From elementary particle to Prakrithi (Nature) all materials and their properties, 
            functions and what can be achieved from them are described in Apara Vidya. The true knowledge of 
            God is given by Para Vidya. Vēdas contain Vidyas that can be further classified as (a) 
            Vignana (All materials True Knowledge) (b) Karma (Duties) (c) Upaasana (Being near to God) 
            (d) Gnana (Knowledge).  Utilizing Karma, Upaasana and Gyana properly and knowing all the 
            materials from the elementary particles to God and getting benefit from them is called Vignana1.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Vēdas are given by God in the form of Rig-Vēda, Yajur-Vēda, Sama-Vēda and Atharva-Vēda. 
            Rig-Vēda contains 10,522 Mantras, Yajur-Vēda contains 1,975 Mantras, Sama-Vēda contains 1,875 Mantras and 
            Atharva-Vēda contains 5,977 Mantras. The total Vēda Mantras are 20349.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vēdas are the knowledge of God.
            At the beginning of creation God gave the knowledge of four Vēdas to four Rishis. 
            Rig Vēd to Agni, Yajur Vēd to Vāyu, Sāma Vēd to Surya and Atharva Vēd to Angirasa. 
            Here the names Agni, Vāyu, Surya and Angirasa belong to Rishis who are humans and are not of 
            any Devatha (divine material) found in Vēdas. 
            The language of Vēdas is Samskrutham (Sanskrit).
            According to Rishis Vēdas are described as follows. Those in which the properties, activities and 
            nature of God are described and in which there is no dispute in the order of creation of the 
            world and in which proofs of science can be found and in which there is no illusion or 
            confusion and in which cause and reason about the universe and its constituents are 
            described and in which truth and only truth is given and which are self vouching are 
            called Vēdas, Sruthis, Nigamas, Chanddass or Mantras.
        </p>
        <h5 class="mb-3">What different Maharishis got to say on the Authorship and importance of Vēdas?</h5>
        <p>
            According to Manu2 “Every Arya must read or listen to Vēda at least once in a day”. <br/>
            According to Rishi Kanva “The descriptions in Vēdas is filled with knowledge and are given by God. <br/> 
            The education in it is completely impartial and only truth is given. I agree to take Vēdas as proof for describing science”. <br/>
            According to Rishi Goutham “Vēdas are eternal and must be taken as proof for Science”. <br/>
            According to Maharishi Patanjali “Our Ancients Agni, Vāyu, Surya, Angirasa, Brahma were born at the beginning of the world (Off course along with many others). 
            From them to us God is the teacher and with the Vēdas He gave us knowledge”. <br/>
            According to Maharishi Kapila “From the knowledge of God, Vēdas were evolved. So Vēdas are self vouching. No other proof is required”. <br/>
            According to Maharishi Sri Krishna Dvipayana (Vyasa Maharishi) “The four Vēdas are filled with all types of education. 
            They are self radiant and contain only truth and nothing but truth. Other than God no one could give them to us”. <br/>
            According to Maharishi Dayanada Saraswathi “Vēdas are given by God. God is omnipotent, ubiquitous and has eternal knowledge. 
            Therefore His Vēdas are without illusion and are self vouching”. 
        </p>

        <h5 class="mb-3">Who can read Vēdas?</h5>
