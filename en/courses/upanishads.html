              Since it is the last chapter of Yajurvēda, it is also called as Vēdānta. 
              This Upanishad is about Jēvāthma and Paramāthma. </p>

            <p>It is heard that there are many branches of Sāma Vēda. 
              Among these branches one of them is “Thalavakāra”. 
              In this there are nine chapters. Kēna is the last Chapter.</p>

            <h4 class="text-primary">3. Katopanishad (U-03)</h4>
            <p>Introduction: Uddalaka is a Rishi with different names like Vājashrava, Goutham etc. 
              He had a son named Nachikētha also referred as Ouddalaka, Ārunni etc.
              Uddalaka performs SarvaMedha Yagna which is also called as Vishwajith. 
              After the Yagna he donates whatever, he has with him. His son Nachikētha asks his father to 
              whom he will donate him to. Uddalaka ignores him three times but at last he says that 
              he will donate him to Mruthyu. In Sanskrit the meaning of Mruthyu is death, Yama, Kal and Āchārya. 
              Here Uddalaka refers to Āchārya and not death. The proof that Mruthyu refers to Āchārya is given by the 
              Atharva Vēd Mantra given below.
            </p>
            <p class="font-weight-bold">

            </p>
            <p>
              In olden days, people in India use to send their children to Gurukul (Boarding School) 
              where the Āchārya and the education become the father and mother for the kids. Since they stay 
              away from their original parents for a long time, sending the children to Gurukul was considered as Mruthyu. 
              Therefore, the word Mruthyu in this Upanishad refers to a particular person but not death.

            <p>
              First Prashna (Question)<br/>
              <p>1.	Sukēsha (Bharadwājā’s son), Shibi Kumara, Sathyakāma, Gārgya (Sourya’s son), Koushlya (son of Ashwala), 
                Vydarbhi (son of Vidarbhi and belonging to Brrugu Gōthra), and Kabandhi (son of Kātyāyana) approached 
                Maharshi Pippala with lamps in their hands in order to acquire the knowledge of Brahmam.</p>
                <p>2.	Then Maharshi Pippala asked them to stay in his Āshrama for a year and do penance with 
                  Brahmacharya and Shraddha. After that they should ask any questions of interest and 
                  he would reply to whatever he knows.</p>
                  <p>3.	After one-year Kabandhi approached Maharshi Pippala and said, 
                    “Swāmi, due to whom these people, the entire living beings and matter is born?”        </p>

            <p>This Upanishad is supposed to belong to Atharva Vēda. This Upanishad is all about Brahma Vidya. 
              It is believed that Brahma Vidya which appears in this Upanishad is originally taught by Maharshi Brahma to Atharva, 
              then Atharva to Angira, then Angira to Sathyavahana, then Sathyavahana to Angirasa and then finally Angira to Shounaka. 
              But no one knows who the actual author of this Upanishad is.</p>
              
            <p>This Upanishad is divided into three main parts and each part is named as Mundaka. 
              Each Mundaka is again divided into two sections. 
              Put together there are 64 slōkās in these six sections.</p>

              </p>
              <p>
                In the second section of first Mundaka, all about Apara Vidya is given and the direction to get 
                Mukthi (salvation) is given. The methods of implementing Apara Vidya and the results that will be 
                obtained due to Apara Vidya are explained.          
              </p>
              <p>
                In the first section of second Mundaka, all about Prakrithi (nature) and creation from Prakrithi is explained. 
                Also, in this section the description of the God’s form and Vishwa Rūpa is given. 
                In the second section of second Mundaka methods of invoking and visualizing (with Buddhi not with eyes) 
                God are explained.
