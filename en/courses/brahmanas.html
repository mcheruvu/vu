                The first Āranyaka deals with Mahāvrata, second Āranyaka about significance of the 
                    Ukthās and the Upanishadic text, third Āranyaka about spiritual meaning of various interpretation of the

                    Second Aranyaka is known as Aitarēya Upanishad. The speculative thoughts, homogeneous body of doctrines and 
                    deeply absorbing concepts are established in this Aranyaka by Mahidāsā Aitarēya. Out of the five Aranyakas, 
                    first, second and third Aranyaka are attributed to Mahidāsā Aitarēya, fourth Āranyaka to Āshvalayana and 
                    fifth Āranyaka to sage Shaunaka. Aitarēya Āranyaka presents highest level of spiritual thoughts and

                <h5 class="pt-4 pb-4 font-weight-bold">Talavakāra Āraṇyaka (Jaiminiyopanishad Darshana) Brāhmana</h5>
                <p>
                    Talavakāra Āraṇyaka belongs to Jaimini Śhākha of Sāma Vēda. 
                    This is only available Āraṇyaka related to Sāma Vēda. It is also known by the 
                    name ‘Jaiminīya Upanishad Brāhmaṇa’ or Jaiminīya Talvakāra Upaniṣhad Brāhmaṇa.’ 
                    According to the Mangalācaraṇa of this Āraṇyaka, Jaimini was the teacher of Talavakāra Ṛṣi, 
                    this text, therefore, can be regarded as written by Talavakāra, a student of Jaimini. 
                    The Āraṇyaka is divided into four chapters (Adhyāya) which are again divided into subsections 
                    called Anuvāka and Khaṇḍa.                   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talavakāra Āraṇyaka is important for its ancient language, terminology, grammatical forms, 
                    and also for its historical and mythological stories (akhyāna) which indicate rituals and beliefs of those times. 
                    It describes few religious beliefs which are not found elsewhere, and this attests that 
                    Talavakāra Āraṇyaka would be of earlier times. Importance of Om and Gāyatri is described here again and again. 
                    Like other Brāhmaṇa texts it does not elaborate rituals in length but gives more space to Sāma-upāsanā. 
                    This may be the reason why it is considered as an Āraṇyaka. Through its contents, 
                    it looks close to Chāndogya Upaniṣhad.

                    Uttarabhāga is divided into 6 prapātakās and 123 kandikas.
