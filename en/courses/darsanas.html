            <h4 id="D-02" class="text-primary">2. NYĀYA DARSHANA (D-02)</h4>
            <p>Nyāya Darshana is written by Maharshi Goutham. In this Sāstra there are two main parts, 
              (a) Deductive (b) Inductive. To investigate Special theory from Ordinary theory is Deductive. 
              Examining the Special observations and identifying the Ordinary theory is Inductive.   
              This Sāstra is used in discussions of knowledge as a special tool of logic. To find the truth with evidence, 
              some rules are necessary. The correct methods of these rules are given in this Sastra.
            </p>
            <p>This Sāstra is also used as Epistemology. That means discretion of knowledge or the philosophical 
              study of human knowledge. In this Sāstra the following are explained in detail. (i) Picture of knowledge, 
              (ii) Borders of knowledge, (iii) Evidence of knowledge, and (iv) Deciding about Truth and Untruth. 
              In this Sāstra the Author has explained not only about the borders of knowledge but also what is across its borders. 
              Some of the things we will know with our experience, and some are beyond our experience. 
              To separate these is most essential and this Sāstra gives us the opportunity to analyze and experience it.
            </p>
            <p>Also, this Sāstra explains about metaphysics. There are many real and unreal things in this nature. 
              This Sāstra differentiates these two and separately shows them. One more important analysis in this 
              Sāstra is about Ehtics. This means the knowledge of duties. This Sāstra clearly states what duty is 
              and what is not. In the ethics section, the Author explains in detail about the definition of duty and 
              how many ways it can be done. Also, this Sāstra gives the method to decide what exactly a human&rsquo;s duty 
              is and how to decide. Also, psychology is discussed in detail giving the idea about mind and its work.
            </p>
            <p>The main idea of this Darshana is to know that to create the Universe material particles (Prakrithi) are required. 
              Without Prakrithi which is called Upādāna-Cause one cannot make the Universe.  
            </p>
          </li>
    
          <li>
            <h4 id="D-03" class="text-primary">3. YŌGA DARSHANA (D-03)</h4>
            <p>This Yōga Darshana is written by Patanjali Maharshi. According to scholars Patanjali Maharshi also 
              wrote Grammar and Āyurvēda theorems. This Yōga Darshana is divided into four parts viz. 
              (1) Samādhi, (2) Sādhana, (3) Vibhūthi, and (4) Kaivalya.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Samādhi Yōgam we have 51 theorems. In this part the meaning of Yōga is explained as Samādhi and 
              the author explains clearly the character of Yōga. Resisting the thoughts in the Manassu is called as Samādhi. 
              In this chapter we will learn how to control the mind business and tricks to resist the thoughts. 
              According to the author, one who resists thoughts can know himself (Jēvāthma).
            </p>
            
            <p>In Sādhana Yōgam we have 55 theorems. In this chapter author explains a number of tricks to 
              sustain the practice of Yōga or Samādhi. The reason for all the pains and sufferings in the 
              world are due to ignorance. The author thoroughly explained about ignorance and the results of 
              ignorance as attachment and hatred. Because of these two one gets into the birth and death cycle. 
              Also, in this chapter the difference between Jēvāthma and Prakrithi is explained. 
              Also, this Sādhana Yōga is called as Astānga Yōgam because of the eight parts that are 
              explained in this part. These are respectively Yama, Niyama, 
              Āsana, Prānnāyāma, Pratyāhāra, Dhāranna, Dhyāna, and Samādhi.
            </p>
            
            <p>In Vibhūthi Yōgam the author explained about Samyama and the Siddhi that is obtained to 
              Yōgi because of Samyama. According to the author, until the Yōgi acquires Astānga Yōga, 
              he cannot get Samyama. The Yōgi who attains Samyama can do many miracles and great works in the Universe. 
              But one who wants to achieve Kaivalya will not get any interest in the magical powers of Samyama. 
              In this Yōgam there are 55 theorems.
            </p>
            
            <p>In the Kaivalya Yōgam we have 34 theorems. In this chapter the author clarifies about 
              different types of Siddhis and Kaivalya as the last step in the practice of Yōga. 
              In this chapter author explains how a Yōgi can take the form of different 
              bodies and perform his remaining Karmas.

            <h4 id="D-06" class="text-primary">6. Vēdantha Darsana (D-06)</h4>
            <p>This Darshana is written by Maharshi Vyasa and is also called as “Brahma Sutra”. 
              This Darshana also refers Vēda as the ultimate testimony. This Darshana completely describes 
              extensively about Brahma (God) and hence the name Brahma Sutra. According to this Darshana, 
              Brahma is the kartha (Maker) for Srshti (Creation), Sthithi (Existence), and Laya (Destruction) 
              but not the material cause. According to this Darshana, Brahma is all-pervading, omniscient, 
              omnipotent, without having time and space boundaries. Brahma doesn&rsquo;t fall into birth and 
              death cycle and doesn&rsquo;t undergo health issues. 
            </p>
            
            <p>Brahma gives appropriate results for the karma performed by the Jivātma (soul in the human form). 
              Brahma is the ultimate Judge. In this manner this Darshana describes the three fundamental aspects 
              (Brahma, Jivātma, and Prakrithi) of the Universe. This Darshana has four chapters, and 
              each chapter has 4 sections with a total of 555 theorems. 
            </p>
            
            <p>In the first chapter Brahma is the kartha of the Srshti, Sthithi, and Laya of the Universe. 
              In this chapter it is proved that Brahma is Saccitānanda (Sat (Exists) + Cith (conscious) + Ananda (Blissful)), 
              Sarvāntaryāmi (al-pervading), Sarvādāra (Supporter of everything), Sarvaniyantha (Ruler of everything), 
              Aparinnāmi (Doesn&rsquo;t change).
            </p>
            
            <p>In the second chapter it is explained that the content in the first chapter is in accordance 
              with Smrithi and can be proved with logic. In this chapter the production of Indriyas (Senses) 
              for living beings is described.  
            </p>
            
            <p>In the third chapter the Gathi (path) of Jiva (Soul), Svapna (Dream), 
              Jagrath (Awaken state), and Shushupthi (Deep Sleep) are described 
              as the karma results that are given by Ishavara (God).
            </p>
            
            <p>In the fourth chapter practicing the tools for acquiring Brahma Jnāna (knowledge), 
              Dēvayāna (Path of Dēvās), Pithriyāna (Path of Gurus, Parents, and Scholars), Mōkshaprāpthi, and 
              its form are explained and proved.
